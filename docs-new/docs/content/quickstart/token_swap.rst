Token Swap
==================

You can swap your ERC20 CPC Tokens
from Ethereum blockchain to CPChain Mainnet by either of the following methods.

Contact us: tokenswap.service@cpchain.io

Using CPC Wallet
----------------------

1. Click the "**Import Wallet**" button in CPC Wallet app,
to import the wallet that holds ERC20 CPC tokens.
Make sure that the imported wallet address is consistent with
original ERC20 CPC Token wallet address.

    You can import wallet by **private key** or **keystore**.
    Note that the token swap only supports wallets using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)*.


    *: The majority of main stream wallets adopt ECDSA as their digital signature algorithm.

2. Transfer ERC20 CPC Tokens from your
wallet to the following burn address:

    .. code-block:: shell

        Ox11111111

    The CPChain Foundation is constantly overseeing the burn address.
    After receiving tokens in 48 hours,
    Mainnet CPC tokens of the same value will be transfered to the imported wallet.
    Tokens in the burn address are going to be burned.



Using Exchange
------------------

Please pay attention to the announcement of the exchanges and CPChain official media channels.


Details Need Attention
---------------------------

There are several points need attention:

1. Transferring tokens from CPChain wallet back to Ethereum wallet (or other wallets) is **not supported**.
#. You can transfer at any time you prefer.
#. You can swap your tokens multiple times.
#. The wallet does not demonstrate the swapping progress bar. Please wait patiently for at most 48 hours.
