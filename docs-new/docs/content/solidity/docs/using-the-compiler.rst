.. _commandline-compiler:

Using the Commandline Compiler
******************************

.. note::
    This section doesn't apply to :ref:`solcjs <solcjs>`.

One of the build targets of the Solidity repository is ``solc``, the solidity commandline compiler.
Using ``solc --help`` provides you with an explanation of all options. The compiler can produce various outputs, ranging from simple binaries and assembly over an abstract syntax tree (parse tree) to estimations of gas usage.
If you only want to compile a single file, you run it as ``solc --bin sourceFile.sol`` and it will print the binary. If you want to get some of the more advanced output variants of ``solc``, it is probably better to tell it to output everything to separate files using ``solc -o outputDirectory --bin --ast --asm sourceFile.sol``.

Before you deploy your contract, activate the optimizer while compiling using ``solc --optimize --bin sourceFile.sol``. By default, the optimizer will optimize the contract for 200 runs. If you want to optimize for initial contract deployment and get the smallest output, set it to ``--runs=1``. If you expect many transactions and don't care for higher deployment cost and output size, set ``--runs`` to a high number.

The commandline compiler will automatically read imported files from the filesystem, but
it is also possible to provide path redirects using ``prefix=path`` in the following way:

::

    solc github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/=/usr/local/lib/dapp-bin/ =/usr/local/lib/fallback file.sol

This essentially instructs the compiler to search for anything starting with
``github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/`` under ``/usr/local/lib/dapp-bin`` and if it does not
find the file there, it will look at ``/usr/local/lib/fallback`` (the empty prefix
always matches). ``solc`` will not read files from the filesystem that lie outside of
the remapping targets and outside of the directories where explicitly specified source
files reside, so things like ``import "/etc/passwd";`` only work if you add ``=/`` as a remapping.

If there are multiple matches due to remappings, the one with the longest common prefix is selected.

For security reasons the compiler has restrictions what directories it can access. Paths (and their subdirectories) of source files specified on the commandline and paths defined by remappings are allowed for import statements, but everything else is rejected. Additional paths (and their subdirectories) can be allowed via the ``--allow-paths /sample/path,/another/sample/path`` switch.

If your contracts use :ref:`libraries <libraries>`, you will notice that the bytecode contains substrings of the form ``__LibraryName______``. You can use ``solc`` as a linker meaning that it will insert the library addresses for you at those points:

Either add ``--libraries "Math:0x12345678901234567890 Heap:0xabcdef0123456"`` to your command to provide an address for each library or store the string in a file (one library per line) and run ``solc`` using ``--libraries fileName``.

If ``solc`` is called with the option ``--link``, all input files are interpreted to be unlinked binaries (hex-encoded) in the ``__LibraryName____``-format given above and are linked in-place (if the input is read from stdin, it is written to stdout). All options except ``--libraries`` are ignored (including ``-o``) in this case.

If ``solc`` is called with the option ``--standard-json``, it will expect a JSON input (as explained below) on the standard input, and return a JSON output on the standard output.

.. _compiler-api:

Compiler Input and Output JSON Description
******************************************

These JSON formats are used by the compiler API as well as are available through ``solc``. These are subject to change,
some fields are optional (as noted), but it is aimed at to only make backwards compatible changes.

The compiler API expects a JSON formatted input and outputs the compilation result in a JSON formatted output.

Comments are of course not permitted and used here only for explanatory purposes.

Error types
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``JSONError``: JSON input doesn't conform to the required format, e.g. input is not a JSON object, the language is not supported, etc.
2. ``IOError``: IO and import processing errors, such as unresolvable URL or hash mismatch in supplied sources.
3. ``ParserError``: Source code doesn't conform to the language rules.
4. ``DocstringParsingError``: The NatSpec tags in the comment block cannot be parsed.
5. ``SyntaxError``: Syntactical error, such as ``continue`` is used outside of a ``for`` loop.
6. ``DeclarationError``: Invalid, unresolvable or clashing identifier names. e.g. ``Identifier not found``
7. ``TypeError``: Error within the type system, such as invalid type conversions, invalid assignments, etc.
8. ``UnimplementedFeatureError``: Feature is not supported by the compiler, but is expected to be supported in future versions.
9. ``InternalCompilerError``: Internal bug triggered in the compiler - this should be reported as an issue.
10. ``Exception``: Unknown failure during compilation - this should be reported as an issue.
11. ``CompilerError``: Invalid use of the compiler stack - this should be reported as an issue.
12. ``FatalError``: Fatal error not processed correctly - this should be reported as an issue.
13. ``Warning``: A warning, which didn't stop the compilation, but should be addressed if possible.
