CPChain Mainnet.

    wallet to a predefined address.
2.  This user stores the hash of the transaction, and submit in the
    wallet/website.
3.  CPChain Foundation acknowledges and affirms this transfer according
    to the transaction hash.
4.  CPChain Foundation transfers CPC tokens of the same value in CPChain
    Mainnet.
