Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript
and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex
user-defined types among other features.

As you will see, it is possible to create contracts for voting,
crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

.. warning::
    The solidity version for CPChain is 0.4.25.
    Other version is not guaranteed compatible with CPChain.

.. note::
    The best way to try out Solidity right now is using
    `Remix <https://remix.ethereum.org/>`_
    (it can take a while to load, please be patient). Remix is a web browser
    based IDE that allows you to write Solidity smart contracts, then deploy 
    and run the smart contracts. 

.. warning::
    Since software is written by humans, it can have bugs. Thus, also
    smart contracts should be created following well-known best-practices in
    software development. This includes code review, testing, audits and correctness proofs.
    Also note that users are sometimes more confident in code than its authors.
    Finally, blockchains have their own things to watch out for, so please take
    a look at the section :ref:`security_considerations`.

Language Documentation
----------------------

On the next pages, we will first see a :ref:`simple smart contract <simple-smart-contract>` written
in Solidity followed by the basics about :ref:`blockchains <blockchain-basics>`
and the :ref:`Ethereum Virtual Machine <the-ethereum-virtual-machine>`.

The next section will explain several *features* of Solidity by giving
useful :ref:`example contracts <voting>`
Remember that you can always try out the contracts
`in your browser <https://remix.ethereum.org>`_!

The last and most extensive section will cover all aspects of Solidity in depth.

If you still have questions, you can try searching or asking on the
`Ethereum Stackexchange <https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/>`_
site, or come to our `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity/>`_.
Ideas for improving Solidity or this documentation are always welcome!
