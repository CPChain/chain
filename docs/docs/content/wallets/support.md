# Support / Troubleshooting

If you have questions or are having trouble setting up or using your wallet of choice, please make sure you've read through all the relevant pages in our Guide. The CPChain team is working hard to support new features on our wallets, and we do our best to keep our documents up to date with the latest available features.

If you have questions after reading the docs, feel free to reach out to us on our [Telegram](https://t.me/cpchain_official) or send email to <info@cpchain.io>.
