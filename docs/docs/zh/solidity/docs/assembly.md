# Solidity Assembly

Solidity defines an assembly language that can also be used without
Solidity. This assembly language can also be used as "inline assembly"
inside Solidity source code. We start with describing how to use inline
assembly and how it differs from standalone assembly and then specify
assembly itself.

## Inline Assembly

For more fine-grained control especially in order to enhance the
language by writing libraries, it is possible to interleave Solidity
statements with inline assembly in a language close to the one of the
virtual machine. Due to the fact that the EVM is a stack machine, it is
often hard to address the correct stack slot and provide arguments to
opcodes at the correct point on the stack. Solidity's inline assembly
tries to facilitate that and other issues arising when writing manual
assembly by the following features:

-   functional-style opcodes: `mul(1, add(2, 3))` instead of
    `push1 3 push1 2 add push1 1 mul`
-   assembly-local variables:
    `let x := add(2, 3)  let y := mload(0x40)  x := add(x, y)`
-   access to external variables:
    `function f(uint x) public { assembly { x := sub(x, 1) } }`
-   labels:
    `let x := 10  repeat: x := sub(x, 1) jumpi(repeat, eq(x, 0))`
-   loops:
    `for { let i := 0 } lt(i, x) { i := add(i, 1) } { y := mul(2, y) }`
-   if statements: `if slt(x, 0) { x := sub(0, x) }`
-   switch statements:
    `switch x case 0 { y := mul(x, 2) } default { y := 0 }`
-   function calls:
    `function f(x) -> y { switch x case 0 { y := 1 } default { y := mul(x, f(sub(x, 1))) }   }`

We now want to describe the inline assembly language in detail.

::: warning

Inline assembly is a way to access the Ethereum Virtual Machine at a low
level. This discards several important safety features of Solidity.

::: tip

TODO: Write about how scoping rules of inline assembly are a bit
different and the complications that arise when for example using
internal functions of libraries. Furthermore, write about the symbols
defined by the compiler.
:::

### Example

The following example provides library code to access the code of
another contract and load it into a `bytes` variable. This is not
possible at all with "plain Solidity" and the idea is that assembly
libraries will be used to enhance the language in such ways.

``` {.}
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

library GetCode {
    function at(address _addr) public view returns (bytes o_code) {
        assembly {
            // retrieve the size of the code, this needs assembly
            let size := extcodesize(_addr)
            // allocate output byte array - this could also be done without assembly
            // by using o_code = new bytes(size)
            o_code := mload(0x40)
            // new "memory end" including padding
            mstore(0x40, add(o_code, and(add(add(size, 0x20), 0x1f), not(0x1f))))
            // store length in memory
            mstore(o_code, size)
            // actually retrieve the code, this needs assembly
            extcodecopy(_addr, add(o_code, 0x20), 0, size)
        }
    }
}
```

Inline assembly could also be beneficial in cases where the optimizer
fails to produce efficient code. Please be aware that assembly is much
more difficult to write because the compiler does not perform checks, so
you should use it for complex things only if you really know what you
are doing.

``` {.}
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

library VectorSum {
    // This function is less efficient because the optimizer currently fails to
    // remove the bounds checks in array access.
    function sumSolidity(uint[] _data) public view returns (uint o_sum) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < _data.length; ++i)
            o_sum += _data[i];
    }

    // We know that we only access the array in bounds, so we can avoid the check.
    // 0x20 needs to be added to an array because the first slot contains the
    // array length.
    function sumAsm(uint[] _data) public view returns (uint o_sum) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < _data.length; ++i) {
            assembly {
                o_sum := add(o_sum, mload(add(add(_data, 0x20), mul(i, 0x20))))
            }
        }
    }

    // Same as above, but accomplish the entire code within inline assembly.
    function sumPureAsm(uint[] _data) public view returns (uint o_sum) {
        assembly {
           // Load the length (first 32 bytes)
           let len := mload(_data)

           // Skip over the length field.
           //
           // Keep temporary variable so it can be incremented in place.
           //
           // NOTE: incrementing _data would result in an unusable
           //       _data variable after this assembly block
           let data := add(_data, 0x20)

           // Iterate until the bound is not met.
           for
               { let end := add(data, len) }
               lt(data, end)
               { data := add(data, 0x20) }
           {
               o_sum := add(o_sum, mload(data))
           }
        }
    }
}
```

### Syntax

Assembly parses comments, literals and identifiers exactly as Solidity,
so you can use the usual `//` and `/* */` comments. Inline assembly is
marked by `assembly { ... }` and inside these curly braces, the
following can be used (see the later sections for more details)

> -   literals, i.e. `0x123`, `42` or `"abc"` (strings up to 32
>     characters)
> -   opcodes (in "instruction style"), e.g. `mload sload dup1 sstore`,
>     for a list see below
> -   opcodes in functional style, e.g. `add(1, mlod(0))`
> -   labels, e.g. `name:`
> -   variable declarations, e.g. `let x := 7`, `let x := add(y, 3)` or
>     `let x` (initial value of empty (0) is assigned)
> -   identifiers (labels or assembly-local variables and externals if
>     used as inline assembly), e.g. `jump(name)`, `3 x add`
> -   assignments (in "instruction style"), e.g. `3 =: x`
> -   assignments in functional style, e.g. `x := add(y, 3)`
> -   blocks where local variables are scoped inside, e.g.
>     `{ let x := 3 { let y := add(x, 1) } }`

### Opcodes

This document does not want to be a full description of the Ethereum
virtual machine, but the following list can be used as a reference of
its opcodes.

If an opcode takes arguments (always from the top of the stack), they
are given in parentheses. Note that the order of arguments can be seen
to be reversed in non-functional style (explained below). Opcodes marked
with `-` do not push an item onto the stack, those marked with `*` are
special and all others push exactly one item onto the stack. Opcodes
marked with `F`, `H`, `B` or `C` are present since Frontier, Homestead,
Byzantium or Constantinople, respectively. Constantinople is still in
planning and all instructions marked as such will result in an invalid
instruction exception.

In the following, `mem[a...b)` signifies the bytes of memory starting at
position `a` up to (excluding) position `b` and `storage[p]` signifies
the storage contents at position `p`.

The opcodes `pushi` and `jumpdest` cannot be used directly.

In the grammar, opcodes are represented as pre-defined identifiers.

### Literals

You can use integer constants by typing them in decimal or hexadecimal
notation and an appropriate `PUSHi` instruction will automatically be
generated. The following creates code to add 2 and 3 resulting in 5 and
then computes the bitwise and with the string "abc". Strings are stored
left-aligned and cannot be longer than 32 bytes.

``` {.}
assembly { 2 3 add "abc" and }
```

### Functional Style

You can type opcode after opcode in the same way they will end up in
bytecode. For example adding `3` to the contents in memory at position
`0x80` would be

``` {.}
3 0x80 mload add 0x80 mstore
```

As it is often hard to see what the actual arguments for certain opcodes
are, Solidity inline assembly also provides a "functional style"
notation where the same code would be written as follows

``` {.}
mstore(0x80, add(mload(0x80), 3))
```

Functional style expressions cannot use instructional style internally,
i.e. `1 2 mstore(0x80, add)` is not valid assembly, it has to be written
as `mstore(0x80, add(2, 1))`. For opcodes that do not take arguments,
the parentheses can be omitted.

Note that the order of arguments is reversed in functional-style as
opposed to the instruction-style way. If you use functional-style, the
first argument will end up on the stack top.

### Access to External Variables and Functions

Solidity variables and other identifiers can be accessed by simply using
their name. For memory variables, this will push the address and not the
value onto the stack. Storage variables are different: Values in storage
might not occupy a full storage slot, so their "address" is composed of
a slot and a byte-offset inside that slot. To retrieve the slot pointed
to by the variable `x`, you used `x_slot` and to retrieve the
byte-offset you used `x_offset`.

In assignments (see below), we can even use local Solidity variables to
assign to.

Functions external to inline assembly can also be accessed: The assembly
will push their entry label (with virtual function resolution applied).
The calling semantics in solidity are:

> -   the caller pushes `return label`, `arg1`, `arg2`, ..., `argn`
> -   the call returns with `ret1`, `ret2`, ..., `retm`

This feature is still a bit cumbersome to use, because the stack offset
essentially changes during the call, and thus references to local
variables will be wrong.

``` {.}
pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

contract C {
    uint b;
    function f(uint x) public returns (uint r) {
        assembly {
            r := mul(x, sload(b_slot)) // ignore the offset, we know it is zero
        }
    }
}
```

::: tip

If you access variables of a type that spans less than 256 bits (for
example `uint64`, `address`, `bytes16` or `byte`), you cannot make any
assumptions about bits not part of the encoding of the type. Especially,
do not assume them to be zero. To be safe, always clear the data
properly before you use it in a context where this is important:
`uint32 x = f(); assembly { x := and(x, 0xffffffff) /* now use x */ }`
To clean signed types, you can use the `signextend` opcode.
:::

### Labels

::: tip

Labels are deprecated. Please use functions, loops, if or switch
statements instead.
:::

Another problem in EVM assembly is that `jump` and `jumpi` use absolute
addresses which can change easily. Solidity inline assembly provides
labels to make the use of jumps easier. Note that labels are a low-level
feature and it is possible to write efficient assembly without labels,
just using assembly functions, loops, if and switch instructions (see
below). The following code computes an element in the Fibonacci series.

``` {.}
{
    let n := calldataload(4)
    let a := 1
    let b := a
loop:
    jumpi(loopend, eq(n, 0))
    a add swap1
    n := sub(n, 1)
    jump(loop)
loopend:
    mstore(0, a)
    return(0, 0x20)
}
```

Please note that automatically accessing stack variables can only work
if the assembler knows the current stack height. This fails to work if
the jump source and target have different stack heights. It is still
fine to use such jumps, but you should just not access any stack
variables (even assembly variables) in that case.

Furthermore, the stack height analyser goes through the code opcode by
opcode (and not according to control flow), so in the following case,
the assembler will have a wrong impression about the stack height at
label `two`:

``` {.}
{
    let x := 8
    jump(two)
    one:
        // Here the stack height is 2 (because we pushed x and 7),
        // but the assembler thinks it is 1 because it reads
        // from top to bottom.
        // Accessing the stack variable x here will lead to errors.
        x := 9
        jump(three)
    two:
        7 // push something onto the stack
        jump(one)
    three:
}
```

### Declaring Assembly-Local Variables

You can use the `let` keyword to declare variables that are only visible
in inline assembly and actually only in the current `{...}`-block. What
happens is that the `let` instruction will create a new stack slot that
is reserved for the variable and automatically removed again when the
end of the block is reached. You need to provide an initial value for
the variable which can be just `0`, but it can also be a complex
functional-style expression.

``` {.}
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

contract C {
    function f(uint x) public view returns (uint b) {
        assembly {
            let v := add(x, 1)
            mstore(0x80, v)
            {
                let y := add(sload(v), 1)
                b := y
            } // y is "deallocated" here
            b := add(b, v)
        } // v is "deallocated" here
    }
}
```

### Assignments

Assignments are possible to assembly-local variables and to
function-local variables. Take care that when you assign to variables
that point to memory or storage, you will only change the pointer and
not the data.

There are two kinds of assignments: functional-style and
instruction-style. For functional-style assignments
(`variable := value`), you need to provide a value in a functional-style
expression that results in exactly one stack value and for
instruction-style (`=: variable`), the value is just taken from the
stack top. For both ways, the colon points to the name of the variable.
The assignment is performed by replacing the variable's value on the
stack by the new value.

``` {.}
{
    let v := 0 // functional-style assignment as part of variable declaration
    let g := add(v, 2)
    sload(10)
    =: v // instruction style assignment, puts the result of sload(10) into v
}
```

::: tip

Instruction-style assignment is deprecated.
:::

### If

The if statement can be used for conditionally executing code. There is
no "else" part, consider using "switch" (see below) if you need multiple
alternatives.

``` {.}
{
    if eq(value, 0) { revert(0, 0) }
}
```

The curly braces for the body are required.

### Switch

You can use a switch statement as a very basic version of "if/else". It
takes the value of an expression and compares it to several constants.
The branch corresponding to the matching constant is taken. Contrary to
the error-prone behaviour of some programming languages, control flow
does not continue from one case to the next. There can be a fallback or
default case called `default`.

``` {.}
{
    let x := 0
    switch calldataload(4)
    case 0 {
        x := calldataload(0x24)
    }
    default {
        x := calldataload(0x44)
    }
    sstore(0, div(x, 2))
}
```

The list of cases does not require curly braces, but the body of a case
does require them.

### Loops

Assembly supports a simple for-style loop. For-style loops have a header
containing an initializing part, a condition and a post-iteration part.
The condition has to be a functional-style expression, while the other
two are blocks. If the initializing part declares any variables, the
scope of these variables is extended into the body (including the
condition and the post-iteration part).

The following example computes the sum of an area in memory.

``` {.}
{
    let x := 0
    for { let i := 0 } lt(i, 0x100) { i := add(i, 0x20) } {
        x := add(x, mload(i))
    }
}
```

For loops can also be written so that they behave like while loops:
Simply leave the initialization and post-iteration parts empty.

``` {.}
{
    let x := 0
    let i := 0
    for { } lt(i, 0x100) { } {     // while(i < 0x100)
        x := add(x, mload(i))
        i := add(i, 0x20)
    }
}
```

### Functions

Assembly allows the definition of low-level functions. These take their
arguments (and a return PC) from the stack and also put the results onto
the stack. Calling a function looks the same way as executing a
functional-style opcode.

Functions can be defined anywhere and are visible in the block they are
declared in. Inside a function, you cannot access local variables
defined outside of that function. There is no explicit `return`
statement.

If you call a function that returns multiple values, you have to assign
them to a tuple using `a, b := f(x)` or `let a, b := f(x)`.

The following example implements the power function by
square-and-multiply.

``` {.}
{
    function power(base, exponent) -> result {
        switch exponent
        case 0 { result := 1 }
        case 1 { result := base }
        default {
            result := power(mul(base, base), div(exponent, 2))
            switch mod(exponent, 2)
                case 1 { result := mul(base, result) }
        }
    }
}
```

### Things to Avoid

Inline assembly might have a quite high-level look, but it actually is
extremely low-level. Function calls, loops, ifs and switches are
converted by simple rewriting rules and after that, the only thing the
assembler does for you is re-arranging functional-style opcodes,
managing jump labels, counting stack height for variable access and
removing stack slots for assembly-local variables when the end of their
block is reached. Especially for those two last cases, it is important
to know that the assembler only counts stack height from top to bottom,
not necessarily following control flow. Furthermore, operations like
swap will only swap the contents of the stack but not the location of
variables.

### Conventions in Solidity

In contrast to EVM assembly, Solidity knows types which are narrower
than 256 bits, e.g. `uint24`. In order to make them more efficient, most
arithmetic operations just treat them as 256-bit numbers and the
higher-order bits are only cleaned at the point where it is necessary,
i.e. just shortly before they are written to memory or before
comparisons are performed. This means that if you access such a variable
from within inline assembly, you might have to manually clean the higher
order bits first.

Solidity manages memory in a very simple way: There is a "free memory
pointer" at position `0x40` in memory. If you want to allocate memory,
just use the memory from that point on and update the pointer
accordingly.

The first 64 bytes of memory can be used as "scratch space" for
short-term allocation. The 32 bytes after the free memory pointer (i.e.
starting at `0x60`) is meant to be zero permanently and is used as the
initial value for empty dynamic memory arrays.

Elements in memory arrays in Solidity always occupy multiples of 32
bytes (yes, this is even true for `byte[]`, but not for `bytes` and
`string`). Multi-dimensional memory arrays are pointers to memory
arrays. The length of a dynamic array is stored at the first slot of the
array and then only the array elements follow.

::: warning

Statically-sized memory arrays do not have a length field, but it will
be added soon to allow better convertibility between statically- and
dynamically-sized arrays, so please do not rely on that.
:::

## Standalone Assembly

The assembly language described as inline assembly above can also be
used standalone and in fact, the plan is to use it as an intermediate
language for the Solidity compiler. In this form, it tries to achieve
several goals:

1.  Programs written in it should be readable, even if the code is
    generated by a compiler from Solidity.
2.  The translation from assembly to bytecode should contain as few
    "surprises" as possible.
3.  Control flow should be easy to detect to help in formal verification
    and optimization.

In order to achieve the first and last goal, assembly provides
high-level constructs like `for` loops, `if` and `switch` statements and
function calls. It should be possible to write assembly programs that do
not make use of explicit `SWAP`, `DUP`, `JUMP` and `JUMPI` statements,
because the first two obfuscate the data flow and the last two obfuscate
control flow. Furthermore, functional statements of the form
`mul(add(x, y), 7)` are preferred over pure opcode statements like
`7 y x add mul` because in the first form, it is much easier to see
which operand is used for which opcode.

The second goal is achieved by compiling the higher level constructs to
bytecode in a very regular way. The only non-local operation performed
by the assembler is name lookup of user-defined identifiers (functions,
variables, ...), which follow very simple and regular scoping rules and
cleanup of local variables from the stack.

Scoping: An identifier that is declared (label, variable, function,
assembly) is only visible in the block where it was declared (including
nested blocks inside the current block). It is not legal to access local
variables across function borders, even if they would be in scope.
Shadowing is not allowed. Local variables cannot be accessed before they
were declared, but labels, functions and assemblies can. Assemblies are
special blocks that are used for e.g. returning runtime code or creating
contracts. No identifier from an outer assembly is visible in a
sub-assembly.

If control flow passes over the end of a block, pop instructions are
inserted that match the number of local variables declared in that
block. Whenever a local variable is referenced, the code generator needs
to know its current relative position in the stack and thus it needs to
keep track of the current so-called stack height. Since all local
variables are removed at the end of a block, the stack height before and
after the block should be the same. If this is not the case, a warning
is issued.

Using `switch`, `for` and functions, it should be possible to write
complex code without using `jump` or `jumpi` manually. This makes it
much easier to analyze the control flow, which allows for improved
formal verification and optimization.

Furthermore, if manual jumps are allowed, computing the stack height is
rather complicated. The position of all local variables on the stack
needs to be known, otherwise neither references to local variables nor
removing local variables automatically from the stack at the end of a
block will work properly.

Example:

We will follow an example compilation from Solidity to assembly. We
consider the runtime bytecode of the following Solidity program:

    pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

    contract C {
      function f(uint x) public pure returns (uint y) {
        y = 1;
        for (uint i = 0; i < x; i++)
          y = 2 * y;
      }
    }

The following assembly will be generated:

    {
      mstore(0x40, 0x60) // store the "free memory pointer"
      // function dispatcher
      switch div(calldataload(0), exp(2, 226))
      case 0xb3de648b {
        let r := f(calldataload(4))
        let ret := $allocate(0x20)
        mstore(ret, r)
        return(ret, 0x20)
      }
      default { revert(0, 0) }
      // memory allocator
      function $allocate(size) -> pos {
        pos := mload(0x40)
        mstore(0x40, add(pos, size))
      }
      // the contract function
      function f(x) -> y {
        y := 1
        for { let i := 0 } lt(i, x) { i := add(i, 1) } {
          y := mul(2, y)
        }
      }
    }

### Assembly Grammar

The tasks of the parser are the following:

-   Turn the byte stream into a token stream, discarding C++-style
    comments (a special comment exists for source references, but we
    will not explain it here).
-   Turn the token stream into an AST according to the grammar below
-   Register identifiers with the block they are defined in (annotation
    to the AST node) and note from which point on, variables can be
    accessed.

The assembly lexer follows the one defined by Solidity itself.

Whitespace is used to delimit tokens and it consists of the characters
Space, Tab and Linefeed. Comments are regular JavaScript/C++ comments
and are interpreted in the same way as Whitespace.
